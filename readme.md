# 📱 Mobile Model Analysis (Flipkart India)  
A Data Science Project analyzing smartphone models from Flipkart’s Indian marketplace using an interactive **Streamlit** app.  

This project aims to uncover brand-wise, feature-wise, and model-wise insights through comprehensive preprocessing, EDA, and visualizations.

---

## 🔍 Project Goals

- Clean and preprocess raw mobile phone data from Flipkart.
- Perform detailed **EDA** (Exploratory Data Analysis) covering:
  - Brand-wise trends
  - Model-wise comparisons
  - Feature-price relationships
  - Market segmentation (Budget / Mid-range / Flagship)
- Build an interactive and user-friendly **Streamlit** dashboard with:
  - Data preprocessing pipeline
  - EDA visualizations
  - Brand explorer
  - Model comparison interface

---

## 📁 Dataset

- Source: Flipkart (Kaggle Dataset)
- Focus: Indian smartphone market
- Format: CSV
- Columns include:
  - Product Name, Actual Price, Discount Price, Ratings, Reviews
  - RAM, Storage, Display Size, Camera Specs, etc.

---

## ⚙️ Preprocessing Steps

1. Extract brand names from product names (with exceptions like `I kall` → `IKall`).
2. Clean and convert price, rating, and review columns.
3. Parse and extract numerical features like RAM, Storage, Camera MP.
4. Fill missing values using **brand-segment-wise medians or modes**.
5. Classify models into `Budget`, `Mid-Range`, or `Flagship` segments.
6. Save cleaned dataset to `Cleaned_Mobiles_Dataset.csv`.
